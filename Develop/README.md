## My Project Title is  
READme.md Generator

## Description (The what, why, and how:)
My project application generates a READme.md file after the user answers the questions. Unfortunately for me, I was generating a styled html page when I first started this project. I must admit, I finished my module work and used some of that code as a start for this project, I was wrong. Once I understood my mistake, I spent several hours changing my code to generate a READme.mdf and hot html. 

## Motivation  
Once I read and understood readme-guide.md file for this project, I was motivated  to code my index,js and my generateMarkdown.js to be run inside of Node.js within the terminal: node index.js  

## Installation (Require steps to install and run)  
Download and install Node.js and NPM

## Screenshot (taken during development)

## Usage (How to use)
